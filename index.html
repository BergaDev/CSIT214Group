          the award-winning and elegant bone china and fine cutlery, giving you a luxurious dining experience, with
          colourful and tempting-smelling dishes.</p>
        <p>We have prepared a variety of meals for you to select from, including appetizers, salads, main courses,

          service just like the top restaurants on the ground. Table setting services are provided, with each dish
          introduced to you one by one.</p>
        <p>If you wish a faster meal service to spare time for rest, we can also provide quicker options for your
          convenience.</p>
