        <h2>Business Class Catering on Long-haul Flights</h2>
        <p>We provide passengers with at least two meal services on long haul flights longer than 8 hours, served with
          the award-winning and elegant bone china and fine cutlery, giving you a luxurious dining experience, with
          colourful and tempting-smelling dishes.</p>
        <p>We have prepared a variety of meals for you to select from, including appetizers, salads, main courses,
          desserts, cheeses of various kinds and fruits. When it comes to main courses, you will be able to taste not

          airlines that offer four main course options.</p>
        <p>As for catering services in the air, you can feel completely at ease. Choose the food you like and enjoy
          service just like the top restaurants on the ground. Table setting services are provided, with each dish
          introduced to you one by one.</p>
        <p>If you wish a faster meal service to spare time for rest, we can also provide quicker options for your
          convenience.</p>
        <p>On board, we have different kinds of snacks available at the center bar.</p>
        <p>Note: There will be some differences for some items on this website owing to different aircraft types and
